# Work Flow

This is how you will interact with this code repository.

At the **START** of the class (if you are working on a different computer):
- **pull** - get the latest version from GitHub

**DURING** class (as you work):
- Write code in VS Code
- Save files normally

At the **END** of class (or whenever you finish something):
- **Stage** - all changes
- **Commit** - with a clear message
- **Push** - your code up to GitHub online

This creates a backup of your code AND lets me see your work!
