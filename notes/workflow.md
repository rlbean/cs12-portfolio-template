# Work Flow

This is how you will interact with this code repository.

At the **START** of the class (if you are working on a different computer):
- **pull** - get the latest version from GitHub
- If working in the Terminal we would run this command:
`git pull template main`
- If working in VSCode and using the GUI we would:
  - Press Ctrl + Shift + P (opens command palette)
  - Type in `Git: Pull from...`
  - template --> main

**DURING** class (as you work):
- Write code in VS Code
- Save files normally

At the **END** of class (or whenever you finish something):
- **Stage** - all changes
- **Commit** - with a clear message
- **Push** - your code up to GitHub online
- We would do the following:
  - Ctrl + Shift + G (brings up Source Control panel)
  - Click + icon to stage the files
  - Type in a message for your commit -- what you did
  - Click **Commit**
  Click **Sync Changes**

This creates a backup of your code AND lets me see your work!
